Hello! from one of my contacts in the dev hiring world here are some tips for your portfolio.

#Include documentation on portfolio projects.

##There are 10 different sections you should consider adding to your documentation.
    ➽ Why did you build this?
    ➽ How do you use this?
    ➽ What is this?
    ➽ Documentation along with examples of what you’ve built or code snippets
    ➽ What are the technologies used?
    ➽ What are the prerequisites?
    ➽ Getting started guide (Installation)
    ➽ Roadmap (only utilized if your project will be used long term)
    ➽ Demo & Current Build Status
    ➽ Credits & License
